# Plan ₿ Network Certificate Generator

This project allow Plan ₿ Network to issue their PGP-signed and timestamped certificates for their students.
These certificates are produced in an "open" way, meaning that we only use open-source tools to issue them.
This allows anyone to audit our process and to verify the authenticity of any issued ceritificate without our permission and any third-party.
